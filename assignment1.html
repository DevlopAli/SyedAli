    <h2>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
    <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
        Technology plays a important role in the business world. 
        It provides the tools and functions on which almost all companies throughout the world run. 
        Some other ways that technology can help a business is improving customer care service. The primary goal of any business is to serve its customers. 
        It does not matter whether your business makes dog food or helps big organisations,  
        the only reason you will stay in business is to serve your customers well and on time. Some examples, you can use technology to improve your customer service in so many ways. 
        Getting customer data and information using information technology tools like websites, cookies and online surveys. You can create a website for your business and get feedback on what your customers need so that you tailor your service basing on what they need. 
        Using IT technology to simplify the way customers pay for your services or products. If your service or product can be ordered online, provide multiple forms of payment via your website. Using electronic mail to notify your customers about new deals and discounts, 
        this will make customers feel cared for and it will drive them to buy. 
        IT can also improve business communication as it is one of the primary drivers of a business. Communication helps in the flow of information within a business. 
        The use of communication technology can simplify the flow of information between a business and its customers, suppliers, employees, and investors. 
        A business can use communication technology tools like electronic mail, mobile phones, and text messaging services, social networks to engage and collect relevant information.

    <h2>1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – 
        what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
        </h2>
    <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
            When you start any project you need to conceder a few things. To have your project be successful, a project needs careful planning. 
            Effective communication and attention to detail. With a proper risk management and a strong project closure. Another way is by using the 5 phrases. 
            Dividing your project management efforts into these five phases can help give your efforts structure and simplify them into a series of logical and manageable steps:
            Project initiation,
            Project planning,
            Project execution,
            Project monitoring and control,
            Project closure.
            Some tools that you can also use are the likes of ‘SLACK’ and ‘TRELLO’. 
            Slack is a communication app for teams, whereas Trello is a project management app that helps you organise and prioritise projects. Basic Trello overview. 
            Trello is a task management app that gives you a visual overview of what is being worked on and who is working on it. It used the Kanban system, 
            which was developed in Toyota as a system to keep production levels high and maintain flexibility. Trello is a system of boards, lists and cards. 
            On Slack, you can communicate with your team and at the same time use multiple external apps for task/project management that are available on the appstore.

    <h2>1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT, e.g. Making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board. 
</h2>
    <div class="wrapper">
    <p>Today the tools which are available to manage projects, range far beyond the accepted Web/Email understanding and mobile communication. 
        Dedicated software has been created to plan, manage and monitor projects. These can include spreadsheet analysis, word processing, presentation of projects to colleagues and giving the ability to monitor productivity. 
        This gives the business the chance to communicate and be more successful. I have been using trello for all of my planning. Link bellow:

    <h2>1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects, what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
</h2>
    <div class="wrapper">
    <p>Bellow i have put it into bullet points:
            Cost - typically escalation of the project & hardware costs due to poor estimating & mission creep.
            Schedule - activities will take longer than expected. Slippages in schedule typically increase costs & delay the receipt of project benefits, with a possible loss of competitiveness.
            Performance - the project will fail to produce results consistent with project specifications.
            Governance - relates to board and management performance with regard to ethics, community stewardship, and company reputation.
            Strategic - resulting from errors in strategy, such as choosing a technology that can’t be made to work.
            Operational - from poor implementation & process problems such as procurement, production, and distribution.
            Legal - arising from regulatory obligations, including contract & litigation brought against the organisation.

    <h2>1.5 - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software, how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
        </h2>
    <div class="wrapper">    
    <p>choosing the right hardware and software combination can be a crucial and costly decision. 
        From realising what performances are needed to complete the task, to how long the roll-out of the project will take. 
        Will the hardware be in the form for physical on-site equipment or will it be “cloud” structured project, with hardware/software off-site. 
        An understanding of the longevity of the equipment, before it needed to be updated/expanded is also to be considered.
            Will the task run on desktop PC? will it need a local network? data storage capacity is needed? How and where that data will be stored, are all factors to be taken into account. 
            What software is needed to perform the task, understanding its limitations and complexity of use? Will technical knowledge of the system its running on be needed, leading to training costs and time. 
            Using off the shelf packages from leading developers like Microsoft, Adobe etc can be fairly intuitive, but to get the most out of any of these requires time and persistent use.

    <h2>1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control
</h2>
    <div class="wrapper">
    <p>I joined Code-nation because i was really into A.I since i was young. 
        I studied physics in college and ended up implementing that into a project. Building a program like iron man interface and also programing a “alexa” type voice command. 
        When i left college and joined the police service, i could not continue to work on it. Now that i joined Code-Nation and my first course was cyber-security, it gave me the opportunity to learn about the basics thus making me go back to my project. 
        Currently i am doing the Development course which is helping me on programming and coding. Both of these courses are amazing and can set you on your career path. 
            Trello has helped me to set up my tasks in terms of what i should be doing and how i should be doing it. I have listed a lot of different cards containing elements within, from links to images. 
            I have made a plan where i have inserted all of that information. Git and GitHub have assisted in terms of letting me add new files or update.

    <h2>1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects, How does GDPR impact digital projects?
</h2>
    <div class="wrapper">
    <p>Lets start of by what GDPR actually means. It stands for General Data Protection Regulation. 
        GDPR applies to any organisation operating within the EU, as well as any organisations outside of the EU which offer goods or services to customers or businesses in the EU. 
        The primary purpose of GDPR is to define standardised data protection laws for all member countries across the European Union. GDPR will: Increase privacy and extend data rights for EU residents. 
        Help EU residents understand personal data use.
            Each of these legs represents a constraint t and an issue with any of the constraints may impact the entire project.

    <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
    </h2>
    <div class="wrapper">    
    <p>The tool that i used to create the site was Virtual studio (VS Code). Using this gave allot of options and configurations. 
        Gaining knowledge from the past 2 weeks from my tutor helped me in understanding how it functions and works. It helped me to create the working environment and the ability to add plug-in extensions.  
        Having the ability now to write in code, now i can use CSS to control and structure the CSS in a greater manner.
        Using trello assisted me in putting all the information in cards where i could move things around that i completed and what needed completing. I set it on private so that only i could configure it. 
        It would have been helpful if i had a development team.
    </p>
    </div>

    <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
</h2>
    <div class="wrapper">
    <p>I like code pen because it’s quick, easy, and has all of the frameworks need to build, compile, and execute HTML,CSS, LESS, SASS, JavaScript and a lot of other things. Virtual code uses Microsoft software development platforms such as windows API, Windows presentation  and windows store. Trello also is a great way to structure out the plan of the website as you can set out SMART targets.
