         WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE!
         
         I am a student at CodeNation studying coding. This website will consist of our assignments.
         Some information about me.
         I joined Code-nation because i was really into A.I since I was young. 
         I studied physics in college and ended up implementing that into a project. 
         Building a program like iron man interface and also programing a “alexa” type voice command. 
          When I left college and joined the police service, i could not continue to work on it. 
          Now that I joined Code-Nation and my first course was cyber-security, 
          it gave me the opportunity to learn about the basics thus making me go back to my project. 
           Currently i am doing the Development course which is helping me on programming and coding. 
           Both of these courses are amazing and can set you on your career path.

           My tutors have been Leona and Liam.
