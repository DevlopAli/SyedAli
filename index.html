    <p>
        I joined Code-nation because i was really into A.I since I was young. 
        I studied physics in college and ended up implementing that into a project. 
        Building a program like iron man interface and also programing a “alexa” type voice command. 
        When I left college and joined the police service, i could not continue to work on it. 
        Now that I joined Code-Nation and my first course was cyber-security, 
        it gave me the opportunity to learn about the basics thus making me go back to my project. 
        Currently i am doing the Development course which is helping me on programming and coding. 
        Both of these courses are amazing and can set you on your career path.
